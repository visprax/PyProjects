# Cosmos

Here we will try to do particle mesh simulation of the large scale structure of the universe (only dark matter with no baryonic physics).

##### Goals:
- Interface C with Python (do heavy compuations in C)

## Physics

Persumably Dark Matter doesn't interact with photon (hence dark) and electromagnetism plays no role in it's dynamics, so on the large scale gravitation 
is the sole dyanmical force, which will assume is non-relativistic for simplicity.

Poisson equation governing the Newtonian gravity field:
