## Web Crawler 

This is a web crawler with `asyncio` coroutines [^1]. As opposed to traditional optimization problem of 
running an algorithm as fast as possible, optimizing a network program involvs efficiently waiting 
for infreqent network events over slow connections, this is where `asynchronous I/O` comes into play.
